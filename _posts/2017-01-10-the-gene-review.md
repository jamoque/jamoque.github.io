When we think about what makes us human, most of us understand that part of that includes what is encoded in our 23 chromosomes. While we have long conjectured as a species that our traits are largely derived from those of our ancestors, our understanding of the ways in which DNA passes these traits to future generations and subsequently manifests itself in our appearance and characteritics is a recent development.

The field of genetics has a surprisingly rich history, filled with some of the greatest scientists the world has ever seen. Darwin, Mendel, Watson, Crick, and many other paragons past set the stage for what turns out to be a somewhat precarious present with a highly uncertain future. In his work, Siddartha Mukherjee explores the events that got us here, the ethical questions we are left with as a result, and the prospects of advancing technologies to come.

## My take on *The Gene*

The primary reason this book interested me is that Mukherjee strikes me as impossibly successful. Winning the Pulitzer Prize for [a book on cancer](https://www.amazon.com/Emperor-All-Maladies-Biography-Cancer/dp/1439170916), while also seeing patients as a practicing physician, while also teaching medical students, while also conducting original research is pretty astounding. [Bill Gates notes](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Best-Books-2016) that doctors are often called "tripe-threats" when they are able to do the last three, making Mukherjee a "quadruple-threat."

The other reason I picked up this book at that I just finished a graduate-level course on Data Science applications of genomics, and I thought it might be interesting to learn more about the subject matter. Obviously, picking up the book is the easy part, and the first thing I noticed after doing so was that it is a substantial volume to say the least. Spanning over 500 pages, it feels like a textbook. After taking the next step of cracking it open, however, I quickly appreciated that it was packed with just as much dense information, if not more, than any overview course in genetics.

It's not until around 50 pages in that you realize that despite feeling like a textbook, it is actually a marvelously crafted story. While the events of the history of genetics span from around 500 B.C. all the way to today, Mukherjee composes them into a unified and cohesive narrative with compelling arcs and a surprising level of intrigue.

The other thing Mukherjee does very well is amalgamating the scientific and historical threads of this story. Like a double-helix winding through time, the two strands are inherently connected, and Mukherjee does a marvelous job not letting one overpower the other. 

In his treatment of the characters, Mukherjee not only celebrates them for the impact on mankind's history. While their accomplishments have immortalized them in biology classrooms around the world fair treatment is given to the nuances of how their lives shaped their work (and vice versa) in a truly mortal way.

## Summary

The following is a summary of *The Gene*. While Mukherjee organizes his volume mostly chronologically, I have elected to divide the coverage into two distinct themes that span the book: discovery and manipulation.

#### Discovering the Gene

Mukherjee begins with Aristotle and Pythagoras, who both had their own theories about how humans developed from sperm and egg. Pythagoras believed all that was needed to form a human was contained in the semen, with the blood of a woman simply providing required nourishment. Aristotle, countered that women must pass on something, since people often exhibit traits found in their mothers and grandmothers. He rightly intuited that mothers and fathers must pass more than materials to their offspring, like brick for a mason or wood for a carpenter. There must also be a transmission of a critical message. Theories from the Middle Ages included semen being a miniature, but fully formed, human that simply expanded in size in the mother's womb like [Magic Grow capsules](https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Capsules-various-themes-package/dp/B000096R2E). 

Mukherjee fast forwards some two thousand or so years from Aristotle before meaningful advancements were made in the field of genetics. Change came when, in 1859, Charles Darwin published “On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection.” Anyone who has taken high school biology in the last twenty or so years probably understands the underlying principle of natural selection, survival of the fittest: some entities have a better chance at living longer in their environments due to certain distinguishing traits that make them better adapted to survival. This gives them a better chance at reproducing, giving them a better chance at passing their heritable traits to offspring, thus propogating those traits.

Darwin never explicitly made the claim that humans were direct descendants of the rest of the animal kingdom, but according to Mukherjee, it wasn't difficult for his contemporary audience to connect the dots to the implications of his theory. Mukherjee claims that Darwin understood both the profanity and the incompleteness of what he was proposing. The source of the incompleteness was heredity. Mukherjee explains it wonderfully:

> "A theory of heredity, Darwin realized, was not peripheral to a theory of evolution; it was of pivotal importance... For Darwin's theory to work, heredity had to possess constancy **and** inconstancy, stability **and** mutation.

In order for Darwin's theory to prove true, information had to be passed down that would allow organisms to inherit the traits of their parents but also allow for occasional mutations that were previously unseen in any of that organism's ancestors. Unable to conjure such a transmittor of information, Darwin came up with the *gemmule*, small paricles in the cells of an organism that contained hereditary information. During puberty, these small particles would be transferred to the sperm and egg cells, which would combined or "blended" during reproduction.

If the above explanation strikes you as less than satisfying, you would not have been alone in the 19th century. In a criticism of the publication of his recent findings, Fleeming Jenkins, a mathetician-engineer, argued rightly that if the two gemmules were simply "blended" as Darwin had suggested, then simple statistics would dictate that any mutations would shortly be diluted by interbreeding, or as Jenkins put it, "swamped by the numbers."

The lack of a congruent theory of heredity ultimately forced Darwin to leave his grand theory incomplete. In the ultimate irony, Mukherjee details the notes and annotations left in pages 50, 51, 53, and 54 of "Experiments in Plant Hybridization." On page 52, which Darwin "mysteriously skipped," Darwin could have read about the pea hybrids produced by Augustine monk Gregor Mendel.

Mukherjee details the life of Gregor Mendel, who aspired to be a teacher but failed his certification exam not once but twice. In lieu of teaching, Mendel was forced to work as a substitute teacher at a monastery. He took up botany as a hobby, planting a crop of peas in the monasterty's courtyard. We all know the story: Mendel began to notice patterns in the characteristics of the pea plants, observing that "Like always begat like." The exception to this observation, of course, came when Mendel began to breed plants with different characteristics: tall and short, green and yellow, wrinkled and smooth. Mendel planted and kept copious records of four hundred thousand seeds. What he discerned from his experiments was that each of these traits was independent. The information for color and height were encoded in seperate, non-related entities. This unit of heredity had the most essential features of a gene as we know it today, but Mendel never gave it a name.

Mendel's work didn't earn him scientific renown during his lifetime. Genetics still wasn't a prominent subject of study in the late 19th century. In the early 20th century, however, Mendel's work began to gain traction in the scientific community. In 1909, Wilhelm Johanssen finally gave a name to the unit of heredity Mendel described: *the gene*. 

In 1911, Thomas Morgan and his team of graduate students were crowded into the now famous "fly room" at Columbia University, conducting experiments on *Drosophila melanogaster* fruit flies. Morgan discovered, through breeding these flies by the thousands, that genes are located on chromosomes and that some genes are on the same chromosome and always inherited together.

The next key development in genetics came from Ronald Fisher and Theodosius Dobzhansky. Fisher combined Darwinian natural selection with Mendelian inheritance using mathematical models, while Dobzhansky conducted even more fruit fly experiments. Dobzhansky also brought two important terms to prominence: *genotype* and *phenotype*. The relationship between genotype and phenotype, and their subsequent relationship with chance probabilities and the environment in which they were formed builds a relatively complete model of genetics.

Crucially in 1944, Oswald Avery finally determined that it was DNA which contained and transmitted the genetic information. Then in 1953, in one of the most famous scientific discoveries in history, Francis Crick and James Watson discovered the double helix shape of DNA.

By this time, the inheritance of phenotypical traits via chromosomal DNA was relatively understood, but it is perhaps clear to the reader that the human genome contains a large amount of information. In 1990, the Human Genoms Project got underway to determine the sequence of base pairs that make up human DNA and identify the mapping of genes to physical and functional characteristics.

### Manipulating the Gene

In addition to the thread of scientific discovery that runs throughout the book, the other dominant theme in the history of genetics, as told by Mukherjee, is humans' desire to manipulate genes.

The first, and perhaps thus far most prominent, manifestation of this desire was the ascendence of eugenics. Hitler's extermination of millions of Jews and other minority groups that he deemed as having suboptimal traits is far and away the most obvious--and most egregious implementation of human genetics. In America, however, many have forgotten the Virginia Sterilization Act of 1924, which allowed states to systematically sterilize "unfit" individuals because of perceived "undesirable" traits like "mental idiocy" and "promiscuity." The law was upheld by the supreme court in *Buck vs. Bell*  and, according to Mukherjee, served as a model act for sterilization laws in many other states. In all, 64,000 individuals were sterilized from the period between 1907 and 1963.

The next form of genetic manipulation, and the one that Mukherjee asserts will have grand implications for our near future is manipulation of genes themselves. In the 1920's, Hermann Muller discovered the physiological and genetic effects of radiation. He had high hopes for the use of his research in positive eugenics. 

It was not until 1973 that Paul Berg, Herb Boyer, and Stanley Cohen created the first molecule with *recombinant* DNA, bringing genetic material together from multiple sources. Seeing the potential and inherent risk in these types of experiments, the scientific community agreed to a moratorium on experiments using recombinant DNA. This moratorium was not universally respected, with so many scientists seeing a chance to publish significant findings in the field.

In 1998, human embryonic stem cells were obtained from human embryos, sparking outrage. In 1999, Jessie Gelsinger became the first person to die in a gene therapy treatment. The perceived recklessness of the experimental trial and the tragic loss set back the field of gene therapy significantly for the next few years.

The "post-genomic world" as Mukherjee refers to it, is largely the wild west. We understand enough to be dangerous. Mukherjee cautions the scientific community to learn from the past. While hypotheticals of couples "shopping around" for traits like blonde hair and blue eyes are compelling topics for university ethics classrooms, Mukherjee points to the history of American eugenics, Nazi Germany's holocaust, and failed gene therapy treatments as practical and tangible reasons for scientists to exercise restraint.

Mukherjee's words effectively summarize the thesis of his work:

> We need a manifesto--or at least a hitchhiker's guide--for the post-genomic world... The task of writing that complete manifesto belongs to another generation, but perhaps we can scribe its opening salvos by recalling the scientific, philosophical, and moral lessons of its history.
