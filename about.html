          <h3>Engineer</h3>
          <p>Ever since I was a little kid I've loved building stuff and tearing stuff apart. I get a little stir crazy if I'm not tinkering with something. I enjoy the process of architecting and implementing software systems. Furthermore, I take great pride in designing those systems to be elegant and written with beautiful code.</p>

          <h3>Programmer</h3>
          <p>As a CS major, my courses have truly stimulated my aforementioned desire to build things. Whether it was software for a synthesizer, an app for finding tailgates, or a toy operating system, the UTCS curriculum has taught me by continually imploring me to write software. I have learned much about data structures, algorithms, the way the computer works, and how I can make it work for me. More importantly, I have learned how to decompose and solve problems with inherent tradeoffs and design decisions, things that are essential for any engineer to deeply understand.</p>

          <p>In addition to my courses, I have had many opportunities to learn outside the classroom. Working for a year at The Daily Texan, I was able to help shift the culture of an organization that wanted so desperately to remain in the rich traditions of their paper-printed past that they nearly missed out on shaping a brighter future in the digital age. Working at the Texan gave me the opportunity to work on a relatively large website with full control over the code base and also taught me a great deal about supervising a team of developers and designers.</p>

          <h3>Teacher</h3>
          <p>Finally, while UT has empowered me to contribute in the classroom as a student, I have also had the great opportunity to contribute in a teaching role as well. Working this semester as a TA for Dr. Alison Norman’s Operating Systems course, I have gained so much more knowledge than I ever could have from taking the course as a student. Teaching is something I have found that I immensely enjoy, and I certainly hope to continue to teach in some capacity in my graduate studies.</p>

          <h3>Technologist</h3>
          <p>I believe technology has a higher purpose. It brings about progress that can advance humanity. I feel called to make this purpose my own. Technology fosters collaboration, maximizes efficiency, drives creativity and stimulates imagination, all of which are essential to growth, regardless of industry or application. I've been told my passion for emerging tech is contagious. I admire companies and organizations that look to not only disrupt an industry, but change the world.</p>

          <h3>Areas of Interest</h3>
          <p>My main area of interest is Machine Learning. My experience and knowledge in computer vision has been shaped by doing things like taking Bryan Klingner's undergraduate course, working on pet projects that use machine perception (which you can view on my <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page), making pull requests to OpenCV, and attending UT’s computer vision reading group and related talks.</p>
